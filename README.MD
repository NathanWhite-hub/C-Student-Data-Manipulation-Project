#C++ Student Data School Project

This project was done for my school as apart of my programming applications class. In this class, I was tasked with writing a program in C++ that took provide student, converted this data into an array of pointers, and manipulated the data. I was also tasked with displaying data by the type of degree the student was working towards as well as displaying invalid email addresses.

This project took me approximately one week to complete and was the first time I had written C++ in such a capacity.
